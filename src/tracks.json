			"topDesc": "The Irish hip-hop scene has seen a resurgence lately, breaking into the mainstream with increasingly high festival-billings and a larger audience than ever.",
			"mainDesc": "But one artist stands out amongst the rest - Kojaque. I first discovered Kojaque through his viral hit \"Midnight Flower\", but it was with his 2018 project \"Deli Daydreams\" that he cemented himself in the scene as the most creative and talented hip-hop artist in the country. \"Deli Daydreams\" was one of my favourite projects of the year, and \"Date Night\" seems like the perfect follow-up. To me it nearly feels like a victory lap, with both Kojaque and Luka Palm dripping with confidence after their new-found success. Kojaque's flow is completely flawless, and sounds like an absolute pro. Luka Palm weaves in and around Kojaque throughout the track and is a great addition. Kean Kavanagh's production is great with a commanding bassline and a late switch-up, which Kojaque rides perfectly. With a track like this, I can't wait to see what Soft Boy Records come out with next."

But when this remix by James Vincent McMorrow came out a few days ago, I was really impressed by how he completely made the song his own, while using a vocal sample from the original track throughout. It transforms the original, more serious song into something completely different, in both sound and mood. I loved James Vincent McMorrow's latest single \"Me and My Friends\", so now I'm really hyped to see what he (and Saint Sister!) comes out with next."

Maybe it's the quirky and sarcastic lines like \"I tried to be subtle, but I'm glad, really, I'm glad that you're alive\" and \"What your grandfather did for the Soviets, well, he was only taking orders, I suppose\", both of which remind me a bit of Car Seat Headrest. It's probably a combination of all these things. This is a sad song about a troubled person, that's brightened up with some great dry humour that gives the song a personality of its own. From what I can see, this group disbanded earlier this year, which is a shame. Hopefully we'll hear great things like this from its members in the future."

Her voice is really unique and you can hear the emotion pouring out in this track. The production is minimalistic, but as more and more instrumentation gets added, the song feels more and more powerful, in a way that never sounds tired or cliche. I keep coming back to this one, and if you give it a listen, I don't think you'll be able to blame me."
